See [[http://cipht.net/2012/06/29/griffin-initial-release.html][this blog post]] for the rationale behind
yet-another-emacs-blog-generator.  I wasn't aware of either org-blog
or org2blog or any of the other things at the time.  From that post:

I wanted to write my posts with [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]], which has sensible
LaTeX-style math input, tables, and syntax highlighting that plays
well with emacs.  Org has its own publishing features, but I wasn't
going to let that stop me from reinventing the wheel for the
/n/\-th time, alas.  So I wrote a quick Jekyll-replacement that
runs inside emacs and uses ~org-mode~ as the post format.

I replaced the liquid templating with a simple approach of reading and
evaluating the contents of the tag as a Lisp expression.  So, there's
no interleaving of template tags and content, which hasn't been a
problem for me yet.

Though it's a quick hack, I'm happy with it -- it scratches my itch,
and I'm sure to improve it as time goes on.  Maybe it can turn into
something useful for other people eventually, too.
